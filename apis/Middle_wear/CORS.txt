In FastAPI, “CORS” stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
It’s a security feature that tells browsers whether they can make requests from one domain to another.

For example:

Your API runs on http://localhost:8000

Your frontend runs on http://localhost:3000
Without CORS setup, browsers will block these requests.
